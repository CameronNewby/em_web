<p>Dreamland is my Pre Collection and was influenced by the poem, ‘Dreamland’ by Lewis Carroll. The poem reminded me of pink skies and a misty atmosphere and I tried to capture this in my designs. I also used a kaleidescope and drew from what I could see and those became the geometric patterns and embriodery patterns. Most of my pieces are layerings of laser cut fabric, with machine stitch and hand embroidery.</p>
