<p>Softsounds is a wallpaper collection created for CAMAC, with an art deco brief. I started the project by listening to 1920â€™s jazz music and drawing my own interpretation of the music, these squiggles then evolved in to geometric shapes and lines. The colour palette was influenced by old Vogue Covers, and is a mix of cool blues and black and white. This project got shortlisted by CAMAC in their Annual Student Wallpaper Competition 2014.</p>
