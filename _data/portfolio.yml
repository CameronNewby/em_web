blurb: <p><strong>I am a Textile Designer,</strong> Graduating from De Montfort University specialising in Mixed Media. I have established a style that consists of a simple clean cut designs and cool colour combinations which are often applied to interior uses, such as wallpapers. My inspiration comes from a vast array of collected imagery, music and surroundings and i always enjoy creating concepts for my projects, which lead to my fascination and understanding of trend forecasting and creating my own trend book. It is important to me that my creations are unique and special with great concepts.</p>
